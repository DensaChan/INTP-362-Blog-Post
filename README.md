# From Java to Python
If you are reading this blog, you must be a current or new grad from a software development major, comp sci, or software eng student. You may even be a STEM student who wants to learn Python for data analytics. Well, you have found the right place as this is where I will take someone proficient in Java or just even new to programming.

Why Python? 
In 2022, Github posted the top programming languages for 2022 with Python overtaking Java. Python is the number 10 top-growing programing language by 22.5%. For those new to programming, python is a user-friendly language as quoted by its creator Guido van Rossum "There's only one way to do it, and that's why it works". Those who have played with previous programming languages, quickly learn there are many ways to write code and often we spend more time debugging than writing code. Python only requires a simple syntax structure and is generally more concise and simply just easier to read.

Environments (IDE)
There are many environments to practice Python. you could easily download the classic notepad++ or use modern IDE's such as VS Code or a replica of Databricks which is Jupiter notebooks. In my second blog post, I will be using Jyuptier notebooks to show a demonstration of data cleaning and how we can simply manipulate tables, create aggregations and clean data to be digested for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. Before we get into that, we are required to learn the basics.
